  <div class="grid-item"><p>A computerized tomography (CT) scan combines a series of X-ray images taken from different angles around your body and uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images (slices) of the bones, blood vessels and soft tissues inside your body. CT scan images provide more-detailed information than plain X-rays do.
CT scans can detect bone and joint problems, like complex bone fractures and tumors.
If you have a condition like cancer, heart disease, emphysema, or liver masses, CT scans can spot it or help doctors see any changes.
They show internal injuries and bleeding, such as those caused by a car accident.
They can help locate a tumor, blood clot, excess fluid, or infection.
Doctors use them to guide treatment plans and procedures, such as biopsies, surgeries, and radiation therapy.
Doctors can compare CT scans to find out if certain treatments are working. For example, scans of a tumor over time can show whether itâ€™s responding to chemotherapy or radiation.</p></div>

                              The heart-lung machine carries blood from the upper-right chamber of the heart (the right atrium) to a special reservoir
                               called an oxygenator. Inside the oxygenator, oxygen bubbles up through the blood and enters the red blood cells. This causes the blood to turn from dark (oxygen-poor) to bright red (oxygen-rich).</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item"> <img img class="gd3" src="images/MRI-scanner.jpg" alt=""></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><p>How does MRI work? MRIs employ powerful magnets which produce a strong magnetic field that forces protons in the body to align with that field. When a radiofrequency current is then pulsed through the patient, the protons are stimulated, and spin out of equilibrium, straining against the pull of the magnetic field.

The following are examples in which an MRI scanner would be used:

anomalies of the brain and spinal cord
tumors, cysts, and other anomalies in various parts of the body
breast cancer screening for women who face a high risk of breast cancer
injuries or abnormalities of the joints, such as the back and knee
certain types of heart problems
diseases of the liver and other abdominal organs
the evaluation of pelvic pain in women, with causes including fibroids and endometriosis
suspected uterine anomalies in women undergoing evaluation for infertility</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive medical test that measures the magnetic fields produced by your brain's electrical currents. It is performed to map brain function and to identify the exact location of the source of epileptic seizures.
