A computerized tomography (CT) scan combines a series of X-ray images taken from different angles around your body and uses computer processing to create cross-sectional images (slices) of the bones, blood vessels and soft tissues inside your body. CT scan images provide more-detailed information than plain X-rays do.
CT scans can detect bone and joint problems, like complex bone fractures and tumors.
If you have a condition like cancer, heart disease, emphysema, or liver masses, CT scans can spot it or help doctors see any changes.
They show internal injuries and bleeding, such as those caused by a car accident.
They can help locate a tumor, blood clot, excess fluid, or infection.
Doctors use them to guide treatment plans and procedures, such as biopsies, surgeries, and radiation therapy.
Doctors can compare CT scans to find out if certain treatments are working. For example, scans of a tumor over time can show whether itâ€™s responding to chemotherapy or radiation.
