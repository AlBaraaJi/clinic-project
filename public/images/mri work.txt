How does MRI work? MRIs employ powerful magnets which produce a strong magnetic field that forces protons in the body to align with that field. When a radiofrequency current is then pulsed through the patient, the protons are stimulated, and spin out of equilibrium, straining against the pull of the magnetic field.

The following are examples in which an MRI scanner would be used:

anomalies of the brain and spinal cord
tumors, cysts, and other anomalies in various parts of the body
breast cancer screening for women who face a high risk of breast cancer
injuries or abnormalities of the joints, such as the back and knee
certain types of heart problems
diseases of the liver and other abdominal organs
the evaluation of pelvic pain in women, with causes including fibroids and endometriosis
suspected uterine anomalies in women undergoing evaluation for infertility
